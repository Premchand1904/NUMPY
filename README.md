# NUMPY IN PYTHON
Welcome to the NumPy in Python repository! This repository contains tutorials, code examples, and resources to help you learn and utilize NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
NumPy (Numerical Python) is an essential library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently. NumPy is widely used in data science, machine learning, and any field that requires numerical calculations.

With NumPy, you can:

1.Create and manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

2.Perform mathematical operations on arrays.

3.Use built-in functions for linear algebra, statistics, and more.

4.Interface with other libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

This repository is designed to help you get comfortable with NumPy and leverage its capabilities for your projects.

<h2>Tutorials and Examples:</h2>

This repository includes various tutorials and code examples that cover different aspects of NumPy:

<h3>Array Creation:</h3> Learn how to create arrays, including multi-dimensional arrays, and initialize them with specific values.
